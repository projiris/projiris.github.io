### How to use:

1) In your Google Drive, create folders and files following the names and structure used here : 
https://docs.google.com/folderview?id=0B0A_zASTMp9WU0NMYW9wXzVQWjg&usp=drivesdk

2) Add to the "Dashboard" sheet the following bound script:
https://gist.github.com/misterfresh/e1c9cf0bb4c777221f84   . 
This will create a new "Update" button with which you can automatically update the Dashboard file. Change the projectFolderName on line 9 in the Dashboard Script to the name of your drive folder if necessary. Publish the Dashboard sheet to the web via File>Publish to the Web.

3) In order for the contact form to work, publish the following script as a Google Web App:
https://gist.github.com/misterfresh/b69d29a97cf415980be2  . In your "Visitors" Google spreadsheet, go to Tools>Script Editor. You can create a free SendGrid account and paste your SendGrid API key in the script. Save the script and click on Publish>Deploy as Web App. .

4) Fill in the correct values in ./conf.js :
    - "dashboardId" is the id of the "Dashboard" Google spreadsheet.
    - "sendContactMessageUrlId" is the id of the Google Web App script that does the email forwarding
    - "shortname" is the website's Disqus identifier
    - "root" is an optional url parameter, that would be the name of the project on GitHub pages.

5) Push to a "gh-pages" branch on GitHub to publish on GitHub Pages

That's it!

### How to customize
You need to have node.js installed. In the project folder, simply run "node server.js" from a terminal.
Open "http://localhost:8080" in your browser.
